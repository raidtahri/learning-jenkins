<h1 align="center">Jenkins CI/CD Learning Projects</h1>

- A hands-on repository to learn Jenkins CI/CD with real mini-projects using Java, Node.js, Docker, and more. Perfect for DevOps beginners preparing for real-world pipelines and AWS integration.
- This repository contains a collection of small, focused projects created to learn and practice Jenkins pipelines, DevOps automation, and CI/CD workflows. Each project is self-contained, represents a different tech stack or use case, and includes a working Jenkinsfile (Pipeline-as-Code).
